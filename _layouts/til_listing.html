  <h1 class="page-heading">Today I've Learned</h1>

  <p>
    These are my "Today I've learned" posts. I write them less professionally than my articles in Article section.
    They are usually made of a topic that is too small for an Article.
  </p>

  <p>
    They all have many typos and bad grammar and honestly I don't care. I care only about sharing some helpful message.
    If you spot any typos please ping me a message or open a Pull Request. Thank you :)

  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.categories.til %}

        {% assign date_format = site.minima.date_format | default: "%b %-d, %Y" %}
        <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: date_format }}</span>
