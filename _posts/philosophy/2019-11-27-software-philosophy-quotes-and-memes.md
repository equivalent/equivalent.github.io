> [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) is an adage stating that organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structure.

If project you work for has 3 different teams that communicate in

those teams suppose to be building.


### Agile

There is difference between `"Agile"` and `"agile web development"`.
Original [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) was about people
and practical approaches that fit the team.

software (like Jira) and processes (like Scrum) as a way how to be
proper `"Agile"` company.

In the original  `agile web development` these were called just `agile metodologies`.
If your company benefits from these tools and approaches then great, use them!
If not find something else that makes your company productive.

because "that big company I've read about is using this"

If the whole `Agile` thing confuse you rather focuse on
