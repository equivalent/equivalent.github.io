### Agile

There is difference between `"Agile"` and `"agile web development"`.
Original [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) was about people
and practical approaches that fit the team.

software (like Jira) and processes (like Scrum) as a way how to be
proper `"Agile"` company.

In the original  `agile web development` these were called just `agile metodologies`.
If your company benefits from these tools and approaches then great, use them!
If not find something else that makes your company productive.

your team is not happy or not productive don't push those tools just
because "that big company I've read about is using this"

If the whole `Agile` thing confuse you rather focuse on
