### Generate ssh key

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

<https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent>

### Install ssh server

```bash
sudo apt install openssh-client

sudo apt install openssh-server
```


### Add public key

Add public key from laptop you want to login (`cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to
server you want to ssh with key.

To do that on server open: `.ssh/authorized_keys` (if it doesn't exist create new file)


```bash
vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Paste in there the content of your laptop's `.ssh/id_rsa.pub` & save

> note: there are 2 online tools [dead drop](http://dead-drop.me/) & [msg drop](http://msg-drop.com/) that will make your life easier if you want to transfer public key from one laptop to another


### Disable password login

then edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

and make sure `PasswordAuthentication` is  to `no`

```
PasswordAuthentication no
```

> in all past Ubuntu versions the value was commented with `#` and set to yes as default `#PasswordAuthentication yes`. Make sure you don't have `#` in front of `PasswordAuthentication no`


save and run

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
```

<https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-openssh>


Now if you try to ssh to that server without that key you will see:

```
myuser@192.168.1.191: Permission denied (publickey).
```
