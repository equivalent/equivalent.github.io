Elastic Beanstalk (EB) is a product from Amazon Web Services (AWS)
that helps you to setup
and maintain your EC2 instances (VMs) under load-balanced environment with
many of security, auto-scaling and monitoring configuration done for
you.

In this talk I will quickly explain choices that you have when you
are dealing with application under [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)
environment  and show you how to set up your infrastructure for
your application in a way that is both AWS and Docker good practice.

We will then introduce AWS Elastic Beanstalk and look at some of its awesome
configuration options.

Our [example AWS EB application](https://github.com/equivalent/docker_rails_aws_elasticbeanstalk_demmo_app)
is developed with Ruby on Rails, but because we are dealing with Docker
you can replicate the steps with any language.
