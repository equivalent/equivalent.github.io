In this article we will setup CI system on fresh Ubuntu 12.04. I'm basing my manual a lot on 
Dan Maclains blog on configuring Jenkins:

* <http://rails-jenkins.danmcclain.net/#1>
* <http://danmcclain.net/blog/2011/11/22/using-jenkins-with-rails/>

## Installation

First install some general stuff:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git curl vim
```

We will begin by adding Jenkins to trusted keys + source list and installing it:

```bash
wget -q -O - http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

This will create Jenkins user, init.d script, and starts jenkins on port `8080`
So you should be able to access Jenkins from `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Jenkins system user configuration

In this part we will add `rvm` to Jenkins user, generate ssh-keys and
add them to github.

```bash
sudo su - jenkins     # login as Jenkins user

# add rvm to Jenkins
bash -s stable < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer)
```

Next (still inside Jenkins user) generate ssh-keys for Jenkins user

```bash
# generate ssh-keys for jenkins
ssh-keygen
```

...and add your public key and  to desired Github profile

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

What I would recommend is to create new Github user (somehing like `my_application-bot` or `build-bot`) and 
add him to a Github group that can pull repository. This way we will separate Build user on another layer ...source code
management layer (just to make thing more secure). 

Next (still inside Jenkins user)  we will [configure git
user](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration)

~~~bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com # yes this should match the github email
~~~

Logout from Jenkins user for now.

```
exit                  # leave jenkins user
```

## Jenkins Plugins

We need to add several plugins to Jenkins. Open your web-browser and visit `http://localhost:8080/pluginManager`.
Click on `Available` tab and search for `Git`, `Github` plugin and install. 

**Note:** Github plugin is not a requirement. If you wont use [Github
webhooks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-webhooks) or just
prefer to run builds manually you can remove it.

Next go to `http://localhost:8080/configure`

In **Git plugin** section set the Global Config `user.name` Value and
Global Config `user.email` Value. These should match the Github user
that we set up 

In the Shell section set `Shell executable` to `/bin/bash` 


## Configuration for Jenkins run

Note: I basing command below on the fact that Jenkins work directory is
in '/var/lib/jenkins/`. Change them if different.

As a sudo user in your Build machine run:

```bash
echo "export rvm_trust_rvmrcs_flag=1" >> /tmp/.rvmrc
sudo mv /tmp/.rvmrc  /var/lib/jenkins/
chmod 755 /var/lib/jenkins/.rvmrc
```

```bash
echo "[ -s "/var/lib/jenkins/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ] && source "/var/lib/jenkins/.rvm/scripts/rvm" >> /tmp/.bashrc
sudo mv /tmp/.bashrc /var/lib/jenkins/
chmod 755 /var/lib/jenkins/.bashrc
```

This will crate files in Jenkins work directory which will be loaded for
Jenkins system user.

## Add Jenkins item

![First step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/equivalent/scrapbook2/master/assets/images/2014/jenkins-ci-step-1.png)

Visit Jenkins website `http://localhost:8080/` and choose to `New item`, name the item (e.g.: run test on master), 
select `Build a free-style software project` option and submit the form.

![Second step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/equivalent/scrapbook2/master/assets/images/2014/jenkins-ci-step-2.png)


At this point we will skip the Github project item (green arrow), select `git` as your `Source Code Management`, 
fill in `Repository URL` (Use the `git@github.com/repo.git` format) and
provide branch (e.g.: `*/master`). You can choose whatewer branch you
want, if you want to apply this to all branches you can use `**`, but I rather recommend to crate deferent items for different branches.

In Build section `Add bulid step`, select `execute shell` and fill in `command` textarea with: 

```bash
source ~/.bashrc                                         # Loads RVM
cd .                                                     # Loads the RVM environment set in the .rvmrc file

rvm current                                              # will display current rvm (debugging purpouse)

cp /var/lib/jenkins/my_database.yml config/database.yml  # copy database yaml to project

bundle install                                           # Installs gems

TEST_ENV_NUMBER=995 RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:drop
TEST_ENV_NUMBER=995 RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:create
TEST_ENV_NUMBER=995 RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:migrate

TEST_ENV_NUMBER=995 RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:schema:load

TEST_ENV_NUMBER=995 rspec spec

export DISPLAY=:0;                                      # eneble jenkins to run firefox selenium websteps
                                                        # on screen

TEST_ENV_NUMBER=995 cucumber    # if you use cucucmber
TEST_ENV_NUMBER=995 spinach     # if you use spinach
```

As you can see I'm dropping and recreating database on each deploy. This is because sometimes branches get out of sync. 

We will be passing the `TEST_ENV_NUMBER` variable to our `database.yml`, more on that in "configure database" section

## Configuring database 

### Install database

In our example we will be using PostgreSQL database. But rest of manual is compatible with MySQL as well

Log back in to your sudo user and install PostgreSQL (if you didn't do that already)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.1 libpq-dev postgresql-contrib
```

(if you have problems installing PostgreSQL have a look on my scrapbook on PostgreSQL <https://github.com/equivalent/scrapbook2/blob/master/postgresql.md> )

### Setup database configuration file for Rails

create database Yam in Jenkins work directory:

```bash
sudo touch /var/lib/jenkins/my_database.yml
sudo chmod 755 /var/lib/jenkins/my_database.yml
sudo vim /var/lib/jenkins/my_database.yml
```

and add following: 

```ruby
default: &default
  host:    localhost
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: 5
  username: ci_jenkins
  password: MyCoolPassword        # change 

test:
  <<: *default
  database: validations_test<%= ENV['TEST_ENV_NUMBER'] %>
```

As you can see here we are using the `ENV['TEST_ENV_NUMBER']`. This way we will be able to run several different items at a same time (e.g.: testing custom branch & deploying staging at a same time) and even parallel tests.

### Add database user for Jenkins

So lets login to PostgreSQL:

```bash
# from sudo user
sudo -u postgres psql
```

...and create `ci_jenkins` database user. 


Because this build machine wont store any business data it's ok for our user to be `SUPERUSER`, therefor we wont have to give him permissions individually for database and this way we can drop and create database as we want.

```sql
CREATE USER ci_jenkins WITH PASSWORD 'MyCoolPassword';
ALTER USER myuser WITH SUPERUSER; 
```
 
## First Jenkins Build

Visit Jenkins from browser again `http://localhost:8080/` and schedule the build

![First build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/equivalent/scrapbook2/master/assets/images/2014/jenkins-ci-step-3.png)


## Jenkins accessible from outside

We will use NginX as a Proxy server in front of Jenkins

Install NginX (unless you have it already)

```bash
# as a sudo user
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/stable --yes
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install nginx
```

Next create NginX site configuration for Jenkins:

```bash
sudo touch /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/jenkins
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/jenkins
```

...and paste into it:

```bash
# /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/jenkins
upstream jenkins_server {
    server 127.0.0.1:8080 fail_timeout=0;
}

# all http requests will be redirect to https

server {
  listen 80 default;
  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
  listen 443 default;
  server_name my-awesome-build-machine.com;  # host/domain where you will
                                             # access the build machine
  # server_name 231.123.123.123;             # ...or if you use IP address

  ssl on;
  ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/ssl/jenkins/server.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/jenkins/server.key;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://jenkins_server;
    proxy_set_header        Host $host;
    proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_connect_timeout   150;
    proxy_send_timeout      100;
    proxy_read_timeout      100;
    proxy_buffers           4 32k;

    client_max_body_size    8m;
    client_body_buffer_size 128k;
  }
}
```

You can find alternative NgenX configurations at
http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration. Especially
if you don't want https use different one.


next generate those Self Signed Certificates under
`/etc/nginx/ssl/jenkins` 

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl/jenkins/
cd /etc/nginx/ssl/jenkins/

sudo openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024          # generate private server key with password
sudo openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr   # generate signing request form key
                                                        # this will promt you to fill in some inforation
                                                        # about "sign" company
                                                        # most import is the Common Name !!! 
# Common Name []:my_application_name.com                # enter here the official name, domain or IP 

sudo cp server.key server.key.org
sudo openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key     # remove password from key

sudo openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt  # sign the certificate (365 days)
```

**Note**: 

when you run `nginx -V` output should say `TLS SNI support enabled`,
othervise NginX don't support SNI.

NginX how to generate Self Signed Certificate stolen from [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-multiple-ssl-certificates-on-one-ip-with-nginx-on-ubuntu-12-04)
Next make sure the main NginX config `etc/nginx/nginx.conf` includes your configuration

```bash
# /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
http {
  
  # ...

  include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*; #this should be there

  # ...
}
```

Also remove the `default` configuration file if it exist
in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`


Test your NginX configuration via `sudo /usr/sbin/nginx -t` and if it's
successful restart NginX:

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

...and visit you build machine domain / IP address (maybe from another
computer)

* My articlo on [how to install NginX from source](https://github.com/equivalent/scrapbook2/blob/master/archive/blogs/2014-02-instaling-nginx-1-4-4-on-ubuntu-from-source.md)

## F.A.Q.

### How to restart Jenkins 

From webinterface: `http://Jenkins_url/restart`

Console restart `sudo service jenkins restart`

### I want Basic Auth in front of Jenkins

if you want Basic Authentication (.htpasswd) prompt on NginX level than
all you have to do is to change NginX configuration for Jenkins site:

```
# /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/jenkins
server {
  # in our example under the "listen 443 default;" server
  # ...

  location / {

    # ...

    auth_basic "You shall not pass !!!";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/security/htpasswd;

    # ...

    proxy_set_header        Authorization "";  # this one is important
                                               # read the "Basic auth NginX - Jenkins triggering Jetty basic auth"
                                               # F.A.Q. section for more info
  }
}
```

### Changing Jenkins port

```
vim /etc/default/jenkin
```

change `HTTP_PORT=8080` to whatever you want. I'll need port 8080
for another application, so I'll use unassigned port 9700: `HTTP_PORT=9700`


### Enabled security and no user can access

If you mange to enable Jenkins security but forgot to create users, or
you forgot passwords to all of your Jenkins webinterface users, just change
`<useSecurity>true</useSecurity>` to `<useSecurity>false</useSecurity>` in
 `/var/lib/jenkins/config.xml`

### User as Administrator

in `/var/lib/jenkins/config.xml` make sure that your user has a line

    <permission>hudson.model.Hudson.Administer:username</permission>

### Basic auth NginX - Jenkins triggering Jetty basic auth

If you manage to set up NginX in front of Jenkins with basic auth
(.htpasswd) and on Jenkins you created Web user own database
credentials. It may happen that now when you try to access the page you
will get NginX basic auth popup and after successful login you will get
another basic auth pop up (w.t.f ?)

When you fail the second popup and you get: 

    HTTP ERROR 401

    Problem accessing /. Reason:

        Bad credentials

    Powered by Jetty://

Reason for this is tat you forgot to tell NginX to proxy pass your
Authorivation header. Webserver (Jetty) that Jenkins is running on will
susspect you failed basic auth unless you pass this header:


    # /etc/nginx/sites-availible/jenkins
    # ....
    proxy_set_header   Authorization "";
    # ....

This should fix it.
