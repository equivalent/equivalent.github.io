In this Article I'll show you how to organize business
classes in [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) so your application
can benefit from [Bounded Contexts](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html)
while still keep Rails conventions and best practices. Solution is also friendly for junior developers.

As this topic is quite extensive article is separated in following
sections:

1. What are Bounded Contexts
2. Bounded Contexts via Interface Objects (theory around this pragmatic solution)
3. Example Rails code
4. Summary
5. Comparison of other ways how to do Bounded Contexts in Rails

If something too long to read please just skip to section you are interested in.

## What are Bounded Contexts

The point of [Bounded Contexts](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html) is to organize the code
inside **business boundaries**.

For example let say we are building an education application
in which you have `students` `teachers` and their `works` inside `lessons`.
After `lesson` is done (published) other students can `comment` each other
works.

So two natural bounded contexts may be:

* `classroom` bounded context
  * creation of lesson and adding students to the lesson
  * students receiving email notifications when they are invited to lesson
  * students uploading their work files
  * teachers receiving email notifications when they new work is uploaded to  lesson
  * publish  the lesson (all the works)
* `public_board` bounded context
  * once the lesson is published students can comment on each other works
  * students will be notified when new comments are added on their work
  * mark lesson as favorite

As you can imagine both bounded contexts are interacting with same
models (`Student`, `Teacher`, `Work`, `Lesson`) just around different
business perspective.

That means you would place all related code & classes for `classroom` to one folder
and all related code to `public_board` to that other folder. As for the shared
models you would create own representation of those models in given
bounded context `Classroom::Student` (ideally with own DB table)
and `PublicBoard::Student` (ideally with own DB table)

> I'll not go into details of how you might sync up  data in those
> cases as this article is not working with this solution.

So what Bounded Contexts are ultimately trying to achieve is organize code into separate business boundaries:

![bounded contexts example 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/equivalent/equivalent.github.io/master/assets/2019/bounded-context-1.jpg)

**In order to fetch data or call functionality of different bounded context you would call
interfaces of those bounded contexts** (you should not call directly classes hidden inside Bounded Context)

> You may be asking: "Are Bounded Contexts something like namespaces e.g.: `/admin` or `/api` ?"
> No, no their not! Think about it this way: "every Bounded Context have
> its own code for admin e.g. `classroom/admin`, `public_board/admin`".
> It's the same structure like if you are building microservices (every
> microservice is own independent application pulling only data
> needed from other microservices) Microservices are the ultimate
> respresentation of Bounded Contexts.
> If you don't understand what I mean by that please watch talk
> [Web Architecture choices & Ruby](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/11594-lrug-march)([mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhEyUYTuSQw)) or
> [Microservices â€¢ Martin Fowler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgdBVIX9ifA)

One key benefit of Bounded Contexts is that you can organize your team
around different Bounded Contexts, therefore you will have less issues
around multiple developers git conflicting each other work.

## Bounded contexts via interface objects

(our solution)

Let me first clarify:

* solution in this article will **not** introduce any requirements for database split or table split for different models or bounded contexts
* solution that I'll demonstrate here will **not** advise to split every Rails application class into separate bounded contexts
* we will also **not** separate controllers to different bounded contexts

> Full explanation why can be found in "Summary" part of the article at the bottom.
> I'll also enlist and compare other Rails Bounded Context solutions.

We will rather create more pragmatic **bounded contexts only around business logic classes** and we will work with same models in same database tables (as would traditional Rails application)

This means we will keep `views`, `models`,`controllers`, as they are in `app/views`
`app/controllers`, `app/models`.

We will move only the `app/jobs/*`, `app/mailers/*`, (and other business logic like  `app/services/*`)
into bounded contexts.

Therefore we will end up with something like:

```
app
  models
    lesson.rb
    student.rb
    work.rb
    teacher.rb
    comment.rb
  controllers
    lessons_controller.rb
    works_controller.rb
    comments_controller.rb
  views
    # ...
  bounded_contexts
    classroom
      lesson_creation_service.rb
      student_mailer.rb
      teacher_mailer.rb
      reprocess_work_thumbnail_job.rb
      work_upload_service.job
    public_board
      comment_posted_job.rb
      student_mailer.rb
```


![bounded contexts example 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/equivalent/equivalent.github.io/master/assets/2019/bounded-context-2.jpg)


But we will go even further. We will introduce **interface objects**
that will allow us to call related bounded contexts from perspective of
the Rails models.

Something like:

```ruby
teacher = Teacher.find(567)
student = Student.find(123)
student = Student.find(654)

# Lesson creation
lesson = teacher.classroom.create_lesson(students: [student1, student2], title: "Battle of Kursk")

# Student uploads Work file
some_file = File.open('/tmp/some_file.doc')
lesson.classroom.upload_work(student: student1, file: some_file)

# publish lesson
lesson.classroom.publish

# post comment to work
work = Work.find(468)
work.public_board.post_comment(student: student2, title: "Great work mate!")

# Student marks lesson as favorite
lesson.public_board.mark_as_favorite(current_user: student1)
```

So point is that you have nice boundary interfaces e.g.: `lesson.public_board`, `lesson.classroom`.

> Give it a second to think  about how this will clean up your models from business logic.
> You will end up with lean models and lean controllers

**If you ever need to cross  different bounded context from within bounded
context you can do that via these  interface objects**. Have a look at `lesson.public_board.cross` calling  `lesson.classroom.cross_boundary_example` in the code example bellow to fully understand what I mean.
Point is you are able to call different bounded context logic without breaking the
convention of: "Never call different Bounded Context class directly"

## Code Example


```ruby
# db/schema.rb
ActiveRecord::Schema.define(version: 2019_05_22_134007) do
  create_table "lessons" do |t|
    t.string "title"
    t.bigint "teacher_id"
    t.boolean "published", default: false
  end

  create_table "students" do |t|
    t.string "email"
  end

  create_table "students_lessons" do |t|
    t.bigint "lesson_id"
    t.bigint "student_id"
  end

  create_table "teachers" do |t|
    t.string "email"
  end

  create_table "works" do |t|
    t.bigint "lesson_id"
    t.bigint "student_id"
  end

  create_table "comments" do |t|
    t.bigint "work_id"
    t.bigint "student_id"
    t.string "content"
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/students.rb
class Student < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :works
  has_many :comments
  has_and_belongs_to_many :lessons
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/teacher.rb
class Teacher < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :lessons

  def classroom
    @classroom ||= Classroom::TeacherInterface.new(self)
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/lesson.rb
class Lesson < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :teacher
  has_many :works
  has_and_belongs_to_many :students

  def classroom
    @classroom ||= Classroom::LessonInterface.new(self)
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/work.rb
class Work < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :student
  belongs_to :lesson
  has_many :comments

  def classroom
    @classroom ||= Classroom::WorkInterface.new(self)
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/models/comment.rb
class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :student
  belongs_to :work
end
```

So far standard Rails stuff, now let's start introducing Bounded
Contexts

#### Bounded Contexts


```ruby
# config/application.rb
module MyApplication
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # ...
    config.autoload_paths << Rails.root.join('app', 'bounded_contexts')
    # ...
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/bounded_contexts/classroom/teacher_interface.rb
module Classroom
  class TeacherInterface
    attr_reader :teacher

    def initialize(teacher)
      @teacher = teacher
    end

    def create_lesson(students:, title:)
      Lesson.transaction do
        Classroom::LessonCreationService.call(students: students, title: title, teacher: teacher)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/bounded_contexts/classroom/lesson_creation_service.rb
module Classroom
  module LessonCreationService
    extend self

    def call(students:, teacher:, title:)
      lesson = Lesson.create!(title: title, teacher: teacher)

      students.each do |student|
        lesson.students << student
        notify_student(student, lesson)
      end

      lesson
    end

    private

    def notify_student(student, lesson)
      Classroom::StudentMailer
        .new_lesson(lesson_id: lesson.id, student_id: student.id)
        .deliver_later
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/bounded_contexts/classroom/student_mailer.rb
class Classroom::StudentMailer < ApplicationMailer
  def new_lesson(lesson_id:, student_id:)
    @lesson = Lesson.find_by!(id: lesson_id)
    @student = Student.find_by!(id: student_id)

    mail(to: @student.email, subject: %{New lesson "#{@lesson.title}"})
  end
end
```


```ruby
# app/bounded_contexts/classroom/lesson_interface.rb
module Classroom
  class LessonInterface
    attr_reader :lesson

    def initialize(lesson)
      @lesson = lesson
    end

    def upload_work(student:, file:)
      Classroom::WorkUploadService.call(student: student, lesson: lesson, file: file)
    end

    def publish
      lesson.published = true
      lesson.save!
    end

    def cross_boundary_example
      # some logic related to classroom
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby

      work.file = file
      work.save!

      notify_teacher(work, teacher)
      schedule_reprocess_work_thumbnail(work)
      work
    end

    private

    def notify_teacher(work, teacher)
      Classroom::TeacherMailer
        .new_work_uploaded_to_lesson(work_id: work.id, teacher_id: teacher.id)
        .deliver_later
    end

    def schedule_reprocess_work_thumbnail(work)
      Classroom::ReprocessWorkThumbnailJob.perform_later(work_id: work.id)
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby

    def new_work_uploaded_to_lesson(work_id:, teacher_id:)
      @work = Work.find_by!(id: work_id)
      @teacher = Teacher.find_by!(id: teacher_id)

      mail(to: @teacher.email, subject: %{New work was added "#{@work.id}"})
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/bounded_contexts/classroom/reprocess_work_thumbnail_job.rb
module Classroom
  class ReprocessWorkThumbnailJob < ActiveJob::Base
    queue_as :classroom

    def perform(work_id:)
      work = Work.find_by!(id: work_id)

      # do something with the work
    end
  end
end
```


```ruby
# app/bounded_contexts/public_board/work_interface.rb
module PublicBoard
  class WorkInterface
    attr_reader :work

    def initialize(work)
      @work = work
    end

    def can_post_comment?(current_user:)
      work.lesson.published && current_user.is_a?(Student)
    end

    def post_comment(student:, content:)
      comment = @work.comments.create!(student: student, content: content)
      PublicBoard::CommentPostedJob.perform_later(comment_id: comment.id)
      PublicBoard::StudentMailer.new_comment_on_your_work(comment_id: comment.id).deliver_later
      comment
    end
  end
end

      # do something with the comment
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby

      @lesson = lesson
    end

    def mark_as_favorite(current_user:)
      # ... some logic
    end

    def cross
      result = lesson.classroom.cross_boundary_example
      # ... you can use the result of different boundary in this boundary
    end
  end
end
```

#### controllers

```ruby
class LessonsController < ApplicationController

  # POST /lessons
  def create
    students = Student.where(id: params[:student_ids])
    lesson = teacher.classroom.create_lesson(students: students, title: params[:title])
    # ...
  end

  # POST /lessons/345/publish
  def publish
    lesson = Lesson.find(params[:lesson_id])
    lesson.classroom.publish
    # ...
  end

  # POST /lessons/345/mark_as_favorite
  def mark_as_favorite
    lesson = Lesson.find(params[:lesson_id])
    current_user_student = Student.find(session[:id])
    lesson.public_board.mark_as_favorite(current_user: current_user_student)
    # ...
  end
end
```

```ruby
class WorksController < ApplicationController

  # POST /lesson/123/works
  def create
    lesson = Lesson.find(params[:lesson_id])
    current_user_student = Student.find(session[:id])

    lesson.classroom.upload_work(student: current_user_student, file: params[:file])
    # ...
  end
end
```

```ruby
class CommentsController < ApplicationController

  # POST /works/123/comments
  def create
    work = Work.find(params[:work_id])
    current_user_student = Student.find(session[:id])

    if work.public_board.can_post_comment?(current_user: current_user_student)
      work.work_interaction.post_comment(student: current_user_student, content: params[:content])
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

## Summary

We (me and my colleagues) are writing Backend code for JSON API Rails application
following way for over a year (dating since late 2017)

Furthermore I also use this pattern for  personal projects in which the server renders HTML (following [majestic monolith](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/) pattern)

These applications are quite extensive in business logic. Our main goal
is to write application code for long term maintainability,
code understandability and team management (as we can organize team members
around different bounded contexts).

> If you creating  small project that will run for couple of months then this may be overkill.

Let me emphasize one more thing: This article took more over a year to be finalize. Behind it are
countless hours of learning, comparing and trying solutions. Lot of real team development. Trial
and error so you have final form that I'm 100% confident with.

#### This solution is not "isolated enough"

Yes that is correct. But main goal of this solution is to introduce
level of organization (code and team) while still keeping the true
nature and experience of Ruby on Rails software development

Biggest benefit of Rails is that it is trying to be as friendly as
possible to junior (and senior) developers by following certain conventions. And although those
conventions may be limiting for large applications they form
basis of community and framework that is still dominating in Ruby world
for more then 15 years.

Therefore this solution still uses traditional ActiveJob, Mailers, Puma
and other vanilla Rails goodies and practices.

Solution is not enforcing new way of thinking around application engine.

#### This solution is overkill for Rails

I've created entire post where I'll try to convince you that this level of organization is needed.
Please read [Why you should consider Bounded Contexts in Rails](https://blog.eq8.eu/til/why-bounded-contexts-are-needed-in-rails.html) where I'll go into details.

## Other ways to do Bounded Contexts in Rails

There are several good resources on Bounded Contexts in Ruby on Rails:

#### Rails engine based Bounded Contexts

In the article [The Modular Monolith: Rails Architecture](https://medium.com/@dan_manges/the-modular-monolith-rails-architecture-fb1023826fc4) by Dan Manges you can read about their solution. They've achieved
bounded contexts by creating [Rails Engine](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) for every bounded context

I've tried this solution on my personal project I found it bit hard to
maintain by myself. Similar to microservices it feels like you are
working on several different applications rather than one monolith. I can totally see
how this can work really well if the company have large team of
developers. But small teams will feel the pain of slow progress.

Drawback of this solution was also that ActiveRecord can use only one
database connection (ideally you want own database for every Bounded
Context) But good news is that soon Rails 6 will be released featuring
[multiple db connections](https://rubyinrails.com/2019/03/25/rails-6-activerecord-multi-db-connection-switching/)

#### Event Driven architecture 

In the book [Domain Driven Design in Rails book](https://blog.arkency.com/domain-driven-rails/) (paid resource) you
can read upon how to achieve independent bounded contexts by following
Event Architecture.

> to better understand what is event architecture I recommending talk [The Many Meanings of Event-Driven Architecture â€¢ Martin Fowler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0)

In short you create isolated bounded contexts and then interacting in-between
those bounded contexts via publishing events. Check out their ruby gem [event store](https://railseventstore.org/) for more info.

Problem is that although I respect and admire this solution it brings
quite different way how to think about the whole application as much
it's no longer the good old pragmatic Rails. Arguably many of the
benefits of event architecture can be achieved by well designed ActiveJobs but that's a topic for another article.

#### Bounded contexts in Phoenix (Elixir)

Other good references explaining Bounded context is [Elixir Phoenix 1.3 by Chris McCord - bounded context in Phoenix](https://youtu.be/tMO28ar0lW8?t=15m31s). It's about different programming language => Elixir (functional programming lang.)

To me this talk was quite eye-opening in term of how to  think of bounded contexts
in Monolith. So I definitely recommending to watch few minutes of that
talk abound bounded contexts.

#### Microservices

Like I said microservices are the ultimate representation of Bounded
Contexts. I've covered this topic in a talk [Web Architecture choices & Ruby](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/11594-lrug-march) ([youtube mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhEyUYTuSQw))

Or if you want even better talk I'm recommending [Microservices talk by Martin Fowler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgdBVIX9ifA)

In general microservices are isolated applications that will just
exchange data / call actions in-between each other via HTTP calls. Although they are cool on paper they
are super hard to do right, especially if you are small team. But they
are great solution if you are Amazon or Google size company.
