In this article I will be writing about common issues that I've stumble
upon using AWS Elastic Beanstalk running Docker environment.
I will be updating this article in future each time I stumble upon
new  issue (...or remember old one) that may happen to you.

Pull Requests are welcome to add more know-hows to this article
(Github logo at the bottom will redirect you to git source of this
Markdown file) as well as any unanswered question and Feedback in comment section bellow.

## Debugging Tools and files

#### Docker stats

In order to debug Docker memory / CPU consumption of given Docker
container you can do: 

```bash
# Get docker container ID
sudo docker ps

# CONTAINER ID
# 8eff1959c23c

# stats on it
docker stats 8eff1959c23c

CONTAINER           CPU %               MEM USAGE/LIMIT     MEM %     NET I/O
8eff1959c23c        0.02%               44.16 MiB/300 MiB   14.72%    278.5 MiB/62.68 MiB
```

#### eb console

AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides [EB CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html)
`$ eb` from which you can do lot of debugging operations. All you need
is to `cd` to the directory where you hold `Dockerrun.aws.json` file and
lunch it from there

```bash
cd ~/folder_where_I_hold_Dockerrunjson/

eb deploy
# will `tar` the dir and deploy it to AWS EB = it will deploy your app

eb status
# Environment details for: myApplication
#   # ....
#   Status: Ready  # when `Updating` it means that either deployment running or some env config is beeing updated you need to wait while  finishes
#   Health: Green  # when `Red` it means that either load balancer cannot access it or the instance is down. Sometimes it happens when CPU is to high

eb events -f
# events that are currently happening on that server e.g.:
# Deploying new version to instance(s).                                  - deployment in progress 
# Batch 3: Starting application deployment on instance(s) [i-fe87ae73]   - what instance is beeing update

eb ssh
# ssh to the instance. 
```

> note: `eb ssh` will work only if you have private key that is allowed
> to access  to server is your `~/.ssh/` dir and you specify the name of that ssh
> key in `folder_with_dockerrun_json/.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml` in
> `default_ec2_keyname`. Look at articles Appending Example 1

#### Important log files

ssh to AWS instance (`eb ssh`)

* `/var/app/current/Dockerrun.aws.json` - view currently deployed EB
  configuration file
* `/var/log/eb-activity.log` - log files of AWS events such as steps
  that are done in order to downloading credentials, pull Docker images,
as well as hook methods.
* `/var/log/docker` and `/var/log/docker-events` - what is happening
  with docker images after `eb-activity` finishes - e.g. starting
containers, die, ...

## Restarting a server

AWS ElasticBeanstalk VMs are configured in a way that it should be ok to
restart them at any point. (all configuration is remembered unless your
DevOps guy is done some custom changes)

```
eb ssh

# once in 
sudo shutdown -r now
```

## 500 Application Versions limit reached

if you get error:

> ERROR: You cannot have more than 500 Application Versions. Either
> remove some Application Versions or request a limit increase.

you need to remove old Application versions. To do that go to enviroment
application versions and select all versions and unselect some of the
latest versions that are active (you need to have those versions presents in case Load Balancer introduce new instances -> that application version zip file will be called)

![remove old application versions step 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/equivalent/scrapbook2/master/assets/images/2017/remove-application-versions-1.png)
![remove old application versions step 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/equivalent/scrapbook2/master/assets/images/2017/remove-application-versions-2.png)


## Application log files

I recommend to read
[this](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_docker_v2config.html#create_deploy_docker_v2config_dockerrun)
article as it fully explain **how you can aggregate logs from your
containers**

The bottom point is that AWS EB is aggregating logs to host VM
`/var/log/containers/containername`

So if your container name is `"name": "nginx-proxy"` then it will be `/var/log/containers/nginx-proxy`. That being said, this only works if you set standard EB
log mount point matching `awseb-logs-containername`:

```json
{
  "AWSEBDockerrunVersion": 2,
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "nginx-proxy",
      "image": "nginx",
      # ...
      "mountPoints": [
        # ...
        {
          "sourceVolume": "awseb-logs-nginx-proxy",
          "containerPath": "/var/log/nginx"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Like I said read the
[mountPoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_docker_v2config.html#create_deploy_docker_v2config_dockerrun)
section of EB documentation if you want full details.

The point is that this way EB will collect container logs so that they
are "accessible" with eb logs download feature 

> Note: EB is already aggregating your Docker containers STDIO to
> `/var/log/containers/`

## Load balancer issues

When setting up new ElasticBeanstalk or when cloning Elastic beanstalk
enviroment, AWS will copy the LoadBalancer setup. But this clonning is
not perfect. Some time lot of security groups are not imported and
sometimes new ones are introduced that may be totaly paranoid

This happened to me recently while cloning EB enviroment. Clone
loadbalancer had new security group that had Outband rule only for HTTP
but not HTTPs. Due to this loadbalancer was saying no instances are
healthy even though they were responding to healthcheck.

Given admin `ssh` to instance (`eb ssh`)
When curl loadbalancer healthcheck endpoint `localhost/heacheck`
Then I get 200 response
But Given I curl curl loadbalancer healthcheck endpoint on Elastic beanstalk dns endpoint `my-app.elasticbeanstalk.com/heacheck`
Then I have no response

So solution was to check not only Inbound rules of EC2 security groups
but also Outbound rules of AWS Elastic Loadbalancer


## Common server issues when docker is not starting

Let say for no good reason (or after deployment) docker containers seems
to start and die

```
tail -f -n 333 /var/log/docker-events.log

# something like :
# 2016-05-12T00:50:48.000000000Zddbde24a9b7dbf5156f1e74cd0d5f0e7463e49f3435c5b9423a5fba0969f3735: (fromequivalent/my_docker_app) start
# 2016-05-12T00:50:49.000000000Zddbde24a9b7dbf5156f1e74cd0d5f0e7463e49f3435c5b9423a5fba0969f3735: (fromequivalent/my_docker_app) die
# 2016-05-12T00:51:48.000000000Zddbde24a9b7dbf5156f1e74cd0d5f0e7463e49f3435c5b9423a5fba0969f3735: (fromequivalent/my_docker_app) start
# 2016-05-12T00:51:49.000000000Zddbde24a9b7dbf5156f1e74cd0d5f0e7463e49f3435c5b9423a5fba0969f3735: (fromequivalent/my_docker_app) die
```

#### Server run out of space

check space usage


```bash
df -h

# Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
#  /dev/xvda1       30G  24G   25G  99% /
#  devtmpfs        2.0G  112K  2.0G   1% /dev
#  tmpfs           2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /dev/shm
```

check particular folder

```
sudo du -sh /var/log
# 49G    /var/log

```

docker images may be takeing too much space 

```
sudo du -sh /var/lib/docker/
13G/var/lib/docker/

sudo du -sh /var/
sudo docker rmi -f $(sudo docker images | grep "<none>" | awk "{print\$3}") # Get rid of all untagged images.
```

#### Image doesn't exist

First just check `cat /var/app/current/Dockerrun.aws.json` and if the
`image` specified in it is the one you want.

 In 90% cases the docker would be
failing just because you mistyped image name (e.g.
`"image":"quay.io/myorg/myapp:live_20160101,",`)

If the `tail -n 333 -f /var/log/eb-activity.log` is saying something
like "Docker image not found" or "You don't have permissions to access
this image" it's usually due this:

* misspelled docker image / endpoint (e.g.
  `"image":"quay.io/myorg/myapp:live_20160101,",`
* wrong credential file name in the `Dockerrun.aws.json`  (look at
  Appending Example 2)
* credentials inside the bucket are not correct (look at Appending
  Example 3)

#### Out of memory

let say that `/var/log/docker-events` have something like 

```
2016-05-12T00:51:01.000000000Z4edd70df83997cdd5487a684b7a1ae2021072627efa7d1db909bb4270d36fbf4: (fromequivalent/little_bastard:latest) start
2016-05-12T03:31:42.000000000Zedcdaf5426465b92519df0b81a3706d0033c329cd2d7aaddf5c4bb7f2ee9752e: (fromequivalent/little_bastard:latest) oom  # <<< !!!! important
2016-05-12T03:31:42.000000000Zedcdaf5426465b92519df0b81a3706d0033c329cd2d7aaddf5c4bb7f2ee9752e: (fromequivalent/little_bastard:latest) die
```

...the `oom` means that docker image `equivalent/little_bastard` don't
have enough memory allocated

Solution: in the ElasticBeanstalk application environment
`Dockerrun.aws.json` 

```
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "request_repeater",
      "image": "equivalent/little-bastard",
      "essential": true,
      "memory": 80,
```

...increase the  memory allocation (`"memory": 80 to e.g. "memory: 100)


## Appendix

#### Example 1 `.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml`

```
branch-defaults:
  default:
    environment: name-of-my-enviroment-qa
  production
    environment: name-of-my-enviroment-production
global:
  application_name: Production myapp.com
  default_ec2_keyname: myapsecretkey
  default_platform: Multi-container Docker 1.6.2 (Generic)
  default_region: us-east-1
  profile: eb-cli
  sc: null
```

#### Example 2  -  authentication in Dockerrun.aws.json

```
  # ...
  "authentication": {
    "bucket": "myapp.com.systems",
    "key": "dockercfg"
  },
  # ...
```

#### Example 3 - corrent credentials inside bucket file

if you use quay.io

```
{
  "auths": {
    "quay.io": {
      "auth":"ZxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxT0=",
      "email": "admin@myapp.com"
    }
  }
}

if you use dockerhub

{
  "auths": {
    "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
      "auth": "Zxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxq",
      "email": "admin@myapp.com"
    },
  }
}
```
